                    LGMVIP, the publishing arm of the University, opened its American office in 1896, 
                    and the US division is now one of the country’s largest academic publishers. An interesting historical link, 
                    predating the press’ establishment in the US, is that Abraham Lincoln was sworn into office on a bible published by OUP; 
                    the same bible was later also used by Barack Obama and Donald Trump at their inaugurations.
